/**
 * The package name 'rest' means the Restful Interfaces. In other words, this package represents
 * the Interfaces Layer.
 * <p/>
 * The following is what the Interfaces Layer should do:
 * This layer holds everything that interacts with other systems, such as web services, RMI interfaces
 * or web applications, and batch processing frontends. It handles interpretation, validation and
 * translation of incoming data. It also handles serialization of outgoing data, such as HTML or XML
 * across HTTP to web browsers or web service clients, or DTO classes and distributed facade interfaces
 * for remote Java clients.
 * <p/>
 * For more details, please see http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/architecture.html
